# Awesome Neomorphism
- An awesome list that curates the best Neomorphism Concept & Neumorphic libraries, tools, design inspiration, tutorials, articles and more. Before going for the Neumorphism & Neumorphic design just understand the concept of Skeuomorphism from where the Neumorphism & Neumorphic design comes up. 

### What is Skeuomorphism?
- An ornament or design on an object copied from a form of the object when made from another material or by other techniques, as an imitation metal rivet mark found on handles of prehistoric pottery.

- The term skeuomorph is compounded from skeuos, meaning "container or tool", and morph·∏ó, meaning "shape". It has been applied to material objects since 1890 and is now also used to describe computer and mobile interfaces.

- Skeuomorphism / Neumorphism UI Trend is a term most often used in graphical user interface design to describe interface objects that mimic their real-world counterparts in how they appear and/or how the user can interact with them. A well-known example is the recycle bin icon used for discarding files. Skeuomorphism makes interface objects familiar to users by using concepts they recognize.

### History of Skeuomorphism
- Many features of wooden buildings were repeated in stone by the Ancient Greeks when they transitioned from wood to masonry construction. Decorative stone features in the Doric order of classical architecture in Greek temples such as triglyphs, mutules, guttae, and modillions are supposed to be derived from true structural and functional features of the early wooden temples. The triglyph and guttae are seen as recreating in stone functional features of the wooden temples that preceded them, respectively the carved beam-ends and six wooden pegs driven in to secure the beam in place.

### History of Skeuomorph Design Web | Mobile | Dekstop
- The history of skeuomorph design can be traced back to Steve Jobs who was a big advocate of computer interfaces using skeuomorphic design. Think back to the earlier versions of iOS software, with the leather binding in the Calendar app and the Contacts app which looked like a physical address book.

## List of Books for the Neumorphism

### What is Neumorphism?
- The main difference between Neumorphism and Skeumorphism is that Skeumorphism only focused on using shadows or gradients. However, Neumorphism focuses on using shadows to create design components which are raised from root layer or vice versa. This gives designs a transition from life-less representations to something more real and close to the world in which we live. And that's the motivation for this library.
